# Customer response

Hello Agatha.

Thanks for your question on this! 

In your message you informed that you are documenting the process of creating a root token via API and also that our documentation is missing the info on how to decode it via API. 

Finally, you finish your message asking how that can be done. 

Well, there's a lot to unpack here. So please bear with me. 

To make my line of taught a bit clearer, as we may have a big conversation on this, I'll outline my response to you on this as follows:

1. [Security concerns about creating and decoding a root token](#security-concerns-about-creating-and-decoding-a-root-token)
2. [A brief discussion of &#34;Production Hardening&#34; Vault](#a-brief-discussion-of-production-hardening-vault)
3. [Questions about the documenting procces and how can we help on getting that better.](#questions-about-the-documenting-process-and-how-can-we-help-on-getting-that-better)
4. [Some final considerations.](#some-final-considerations)

TLDR. of all this is the following: "Creating a root token should be done rarely, if ever, and should not be done via API."

I'll try to explain this better in the lines that follow.


### Security concerns about creating and decoding a root token

### A brief discussion of "[Production Hardening](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/operations/production-hardening)" Vault

### Questions about the documenting process and how can we help on getting that better

### Some final considerations
