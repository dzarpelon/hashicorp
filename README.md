# Hashicorp Senior Designated Support Engineer interview process

# Hello !

Hey, hello there!
I'm Diego Zarpelon and I hope you like this.

This repo was created so I can share the information requested about the technical assignment.
I'll do my best to put everything in here as thoroughly as possible, but do not exitate to ask for clarifications (or maybe give some constructive feedback or simply pinpoint mistakes :D ) if needed!

## Repo structure

Well, let's go through this!

For security, as I don't know if I should share the files, the questionaire will be added to the .gitignore file. This way it's not on the internet.

Also for easiness of reading, I'll put each exercise on a separate file.

For now, I think that's it.

Hopefully we will see eachother soon as part of the same Team!
